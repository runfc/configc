# configc - Configuration Management Library

*DISCLAIMER: Please do not use this in production, it not even close to be ready!*

----

Configc is meant to be a library that you embed into your software, giving you the ability to perform configuration
management directly from your code base.

In a modern and big infrastructure, managing the state of the servers, specially "bare-metal", is a complex task.
Operation teams will commonly use popular SCMs that provides their own DSL language.  While this works well at first, it
often leads to complex DSL-files that may not provide the full potential of a programming language with flow control and
rich features for modularity and reusability.

Thus, configc takes a slightly different approach from popular SCM tools where you interact with their DSL and
command-line tools.  Instead, you embed configc capabilities into your "language of preference"[*] to design the
configuration management that you need.

Configc is, at least for now; an experiment of library that can be binded into other languages. Aiming at providing
the common set of feature and behavior that you would consume either in its native language (C language) or from
another language that exposes configc's APIs.

[*] as long as it supports binding to C code

## Libraries

* [configc-rust](https://github.com/runfc/configc-rust) - Rust-based library for configc

## Hacking

As of now, the most interesting thing you can do is to run our test-suite with the following command:

```bash
make tests
```

Contributions are more than welcome!
